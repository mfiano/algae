Assortment of Lisp Game Algorithms and Experiments

## Overview

This project houses some mostly self-contained algorithms, data structures, and
experiments that have proven useful at least once during my many years of game
development in Common Lisp. There are some ideas that may overlap other domains
outside of game development, but all of my work is in this field, so I'm not
sure how useful they'd be.

It is broken up into separate packages for each idea, with some more complex
ideas arranged into sub-packages. If time was on my side, there should be a
separate basic documentation in the the particular idea's top-level comments,
but there are no promises here -- a lot of this code qas quick exploratory ideas
that haven't been fleshed out completely, and haven't been revisited since.

While this repository is mostly for personal use, I welcome any feedback or
questions you may have, and if you find anything useful for your own pursuit,
I'd be happy to hear from you.
